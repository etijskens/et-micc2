.. _TutorialGettingStarted:

1. Getting started with Micc2
=============================

.. note::

   These tutorials focus not just on how to use micc2_. Rather they describe a workflow
   for how you cac set up a python project and develop it using best practises, with the
   help of Micc2_. 

Micc2_ aims at providing a practical interface to the many aspects of managing a
Python project: setting up a new project in a standardized way, adding
documentation, version control, publishing the code to PyPI_, building binary
extension modules in C++ or Fortran, dependency management, ... For all these
aspects there are tools available, yet, with each new project, I found myself
struggling to get everything right and looking up the details. Micc2_ is an attempt to
wrap all the details by providing the user with a standardized yet flexible workflow
for managing a Python project. Standardizing is a great way to increase
productivity. For many aspects, the tools used by Micc2_ are completely hidden from
the user, e.g. project setup, adding components, building binary extensions, ...
For other aspects Micc2_ provides just the necessary setup for you to use other tools
as you need them. Learning to use the following tools is certainly beneficial:

* Git_: for version control. Its use is optional but highly recommended. See
  :ref:`version-control-management` for some basic git_ coverage.

* Pytest_: for (unit) testing. Also optional and also highly recommended.

The basic commands for these tools are covered in these tutorials.

.. _create-proj:

1.1. Creating a project with micc2
----------------------------------

Creating a new project with micc2_ is simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 create path/to/my-first-project

This creates a new project *my-first-project* in folder ``path/to``. Note that the
directory ``path/to/my-first-project`` must either not exist, or be empty.

Typically, you will create a new project in the current working directory, say: your
workspace, so first ``cd`` into your workspace directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    > cd path/to/workspace

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 create my-first-project --remote=none
    [INFO]           [ Creating project directory (my-first-project):
    [INFO]               Python top-level package (my_first_project):
    [INFO]               [ Creating local git repository
    [INFO]               ] done.
    [WARNING]            Creation of remote GitHub repository not requested.
    [INFO]           ] done.
    

As the output tells, micc2_ has created a new project in directory
:file:`my-first-project` containing a python package
:file:`my_first_project`. This is a directory with an :file:`__init__.py` file,
containing the Pythonvariables, classes and meethods it needs to expose. This
directory and its contents represent the Python module.

.. code-block:: bash

    > my-first-project          # the project directory└── my_first_project      # the package directory    └── __init__.py       # the file where your Python code goes

.. note::

   Next to the *package* structure - a directory with an :file:`__init__.py`
   filePython also allows for *module* structure - a mere :file:`my_first_project.py
   file - containing the Python variables, classes and meethods it needs to expose.
   The*module* structure is essentially a single file and Python-only approach, which
   often turns out to be too restrictive. As of v3.0 micc2_ only supports the creation of
   modules with a *packages* structure, which allows for adding submodules, command
   line interfaces (CLIs), and binary extension modules builtfrom other languages as
   C++ and Fortran. Micc2_ greatly facilitates adding suchcomponents.

Note that the module name differs slightly from the project name. Dashes are been
replaced with underscores and uppercase with lowercase in order to yield a
`PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names>`_
compliant module name. If you want your module name to be unrelated to your project
name, check out the :ref:`project-and-module-naming` section.

Micc2_ automatically creates a local git_ repository for our project (provided the
``git`` command is available) and it commits all the project files that it generated
with commit message 'And so this begun...'. The ``--remote=none`` flag prevents
Micc2_ from also creating a remote repository on GitHub_. Without that flag, Micc2_
would have created a public remote repository on GitHub_ and pushed that first commit
(tht requires that we have set up Micc2_ with a GitHub_ username and a personal access
token for it as described in :ref:`micc2-setup`. You can also request the remote
repository to be private by specifying ``--remote=private``.

After creating the project, we ``cd`` into the project directory. All Micc2_
commands detect automatically that they are run from a project directory and
consequently act on the project in the current working directory. E.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    > > cd my-first-project

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 info
    Project my-first-project located at /Users/etijskens/software/dev/workspace/et-micc2-tutorials-workspace-tmp/my-first-project
      package: my_first_project
      version: 0.0.0
      contents:
        my_first_project  top-level package      (source in my_first_project/__init__.py)
    

As the ``info`` subcommand, shows info on a project, is running inside the
:file:`my-first-project` directory, we get the info on the
:file:`my-first-project` project.

To apply a Micc2_ command to a project that is not in the current working directory see
:ref:`micc-project-path`.

.. note::

   Micc2 has a built-in help function: ``micc2 --help`` shows the global options, which
   appear in front of the subcommand, and lists the subcommands, and ``micc2 subcommand
   --help``, prints detailed help for a subcommand.

.. _project-and-module-naming:

1.1.1. What's in a name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name you choose for your project is not without consequences. Ideally, a project
name is:

* descriptive,

* unique,

* short.

Although one might think of even more requirements, such as being easy to type,
satisfying these three is already hard enough. E.g. the name
:file:`my_nifty_module` may possibly be unique, but it is neither descriptive,
neither short. On the other hand, :file:`dot_product` is descriptive, reasonably
short, but probably not unique. Even :file:`my_dot_product` is probably not
unique, and, in addition, confusing to any user that might want to adopt *your*
:file:`my_dot_product`. A unique name - or at least a name that has not been taken
before - becomes really important when you want to publish your code for others to use
it (see :ref:`publishing` for details). The standard place to publish Python code is
the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_, where you find hundreds of
thousands of projects, many of which are really interesting and of high quality. Even
if there are only a few colleagues that you want to share your code with, you make their
life (as well as yours) easier when you publish your :file:`my_nifty_module`  at
PyPI_. To install your :file:`my_nifty_module` they will only need to type:

.. code-block:: bash

    > python -m pip install my_nifty_module

The name *my_nifty_module* is not used so far, but nevertheless we recommend to
choose a better name. 

If you intend to publish your code on PyPI_, we recommend that you create your project
with the ``--publish`` flag. Micc2_ then checks if the name you want to use for your
project is still available on PyPI_. If not, it refuses to create the project and asks
you to use another name for your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 create oops --publish
    [ERROR]
        The name 'oops' is already in use on PyPI.
        The project is not created.
        You must choose another name if you want to publish your code on PyPI.
    

As there are indeed hundreds of thousands of Python packages published on PyPI_,
finding a good name has become quite hard. Personally, I often use a simple and short
descriptive name, prefixed by my initials, :file:`et-`, which usually makes the
name unique. E.g :file:`et-oops` does not exist. This has the additional advantage
that all my published modules are grouped in the alphabetic PyPI_ listing.

Another point of attention is that although in principle project names can be
anything supported by your OS file system, as they are just the name of a directory,
Micc2_ insists that module and package names comply with the
`PEP8 module naming rules <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names>`_.
Micc2_ derives the package (or module) name from the project name as follows:

* capitals are replaced by lower-case

* hyphens ``'-'`` are replaced by underscores ``'_'``

If the resulting module name is not PEP8 compliant, you get an informative error
message:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc create 1proj
    /bin/sh: micc: command not found
    

The last line indicates that you can specify an explicit module name, unrelated to the
project name. In that case PEP8 compliance is not checked. The responsability is then
all yours.

.. _first-steps:

1.2. First steps in project management using Micc2
--------------------------------------------------

.. _micc-project-path:

1.2.1. The project path in Micc2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All micc2_ commands accept the global ``--project-path=<path>`` parameter.
Global parameters appear *before* the subcommand name. E.g. the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 --project-path path/to/my_project info

will print the info on the project located at :file:`path/to/my_project`. This can
conveniently be abbreviated as:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 -p path/to/my_project info

Even the ``create`` command accepts the global ``--project-path=<path>``
parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 -p path/to/my_project create

will attempt to create project :file:`my_project` at the specified location. The
command is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 create path/to/my_project

The default value for the project path is the current working directory. Micc2_
commands without an explicitly specified project path will act on the project in the
current working directory.

.. _virtual-environments:

1.2.2. Virtual environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Virtual environments enable you to set up a Python environment that is isolated from
the installed Python on your system and from other virtual environments. In this way
you can easily cope with varying dependencies between your Python projects.

For a detailed introduction to virtual environments see
`Python Virtual Environments: A Primer <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`_.


When you are developing or using several Python projects simultaneously, it can 
become difficult for a single Python environment to satisfy all the dependency
requirements of these projects. Dependency conflicts can easily arise. Python
promotes and facilitates code reuse and as a consequence Python tools typically
depend on tens to hundreds of other modules. If tool-A and tool-B both need module-C,
but each requires a different version of it, there is a conflict because it is
impossible to install two different versions of the same module in a Python
environment. The  solution that the Python community has come up with for this problem
is the construction of *virtual environments*, which isolates the dependencies of
a single project in a single environment.

For this reason it is recommended to create a virtual environment for every project
you start. Here is how that goes:

.. _venv:

1.2.2.1. Creating virtual environments
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    > python -m venv .venv-my-first-project
    

This creates a directory :file:`.venv-my-first-project` representing the
virtual environment. The Python version of this virtual environment is the Python
version that was used to create it. Use the ``tree`` command to get an overview of its
directory structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    > tree .venv-my-first-project -L 4
    .venv-my-first-project
    ├── bin
    │   ├── Activate.ps1
    │   ├── activate
    │   ├── activate.csh
    │   ├── activate.fish
    │   ├── easy_install
    │   ├── easy_install-3.8
    │   ├── pip
    │   ├── pip3
    │   ├── pip3.8
    │   ├── python -> /Users/etijskens/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5/bin/python
    │   └── python3 -> python
    ├── include
    ├── lib
    │   └── python3.8
    │       └── site-packages
    │           ├── __pycache__
    │           ├── easy_install.py
    │           ├── pip
    │           ├── pip-20.1.1.dist-info
    │           ├── pkg_resources
    │           ├── setuptools
    │           └── setuptools-47.1.0.dist-info
    └── pyvenv.cfg
    
    11 directories, 13 files
    

As you can see there is a :file:`bin`, :file:`include`, and a :file:`lib` directory.
In the :file:`bin` directory you find installed commands, like :file:`activate`,
:file:`pip`, and the :file:`python` of the virtual environment. The :file:`lib`
directory contains the installed site-packages, and the :file:`include`
directory containes include files of installed site-packages for use with C, C++ or
Fortran.

If the Python version you used to create the virtual environment has pre-installed
packages you can make them available in your virtual environment by adding the
``--system-site-packages`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    > python -m venv .venv-my-first-project --system-site-packages

This is especially useful in HPC environments, where the pre-installed packages
typically have a better computational efficiency.

As to where you create these virtual environments there are two common approaches.
One is to create a :file:`venvs` directory where you put all your virtual
environments. This is practical if you have virtual environments which are common to
several projects. The other one is to have one virtual environment for each project
and locate it in the project directory. Note that if you have several Python versions
on your system you may also create several virtual environments with different
Python versions for a project.

In order to use a virtual environment, you must activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    > . .venv-my-first-project/bin/activate
    (.venv-my-first-project) >

Note how the prompt has changed as to indicate that the virtual environment is active,
and that current Python is now that of the virtual environment, and the only Python
packages available are the ones installed in it, as well as the system site packages of
the corresponding Python if the virtual environmnet was created with the
``--system-site-packages`` flag. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (.venv-my-first-project) > deactivate
    > 

The prompt has turned back to normal.

So far, the virtual environment is pretty much empty (except for the system site
packages if if was created with the ``--system-site-packages`` flag). We must
install the packages that our project needs. Pip_ does the trick:

.. code-block:: bash

    > python -m pip install some-needed-package

We must also install the project itself, if it is to be used in the virtual environment.
If the project is not under development, we can just run ``pip install``. Otherwise,
we want the code changes that we make while developing to be instantaneously visible
in the virtual environment. Pip_ can do *editable installs*, but only for packages
which provide a :file:`setup.py` file. Micc2_ does not provide :file:`setup.py`
files for its projects, but it has a simple workaround for editable installs. First
``cd`` into your project directory and activate its virtual environment, then run
the :file:`install-e.py` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    > cd path/to/my-first-project
    > source .venv-my-first-project/bin/activate
    (.venv-my-first-project)> python ~/.micc2/scripts/install-e.py
    ...
    Editable install of my-first-project is ready.

If something is wrong with a virtual environment, you can simply delete it:

.. code-block:: bash

    > rm -rf .venv-my-first-project

and recreate it.

.. _modules-and-scripts:

1.2.3. Modules and scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Python script is a piece of Python code that performs a certain task. A Python module,
on the other hand, is a piece of Python code that provides a client code, such as a
script, with useful Python classes, functions, objects, and so on, to facilitate the
script's task. To that end client code must import the module.

Python has a mechanism that allows a Python file to behave as both as a script and as
module. Consider this Python file :file:`my_first_project.py`. as it was created
by Micc2_ in the first place. Note that Micc2_ always creates project files
containing fully functional examples to demonstrate how things are supposed to be
done.

.. code-block:: python

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
    Package my_first_project
    ========================
    
    A hello world example.
    """
    
    __version__ = "0.0.0"
    
    def hello(who="world"):
        """A "Hello world" method.
    
        :param str who: whom to say hello to
        :returns: a string
        """
        result = f"Hello {who}!"
        return result

The module file starts with a file doc-string that describes what the file about and a
``__version__`` definition and then goes on defining a simple :file:`hello`
method. A client script :file:`script.py` can import the
:file:`my_first_project.py` module to use its :file:`hello` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # file script.py
    import my_first_project
    print(my_first_project.hello("dear students"))

When executed, this results in printing ``Hello dear students!``

.. code-block:: bash

    > python script.py
    Hello dear students!

Python has an interesting idiom for allowing a module also to behave as a script.
Python defines a ``__name__`` variable for each file it interprets. When the file is
executed as a script, as in ``python script.py``, the
``__name__`` variable is set to ``__main__`` and when the file is imported the __name__``
variable is set to the module name. By testing the value of the __name__`` variable we
can selectively execute statements depending on whether a Python file is imported or
executed as a script. E.g. below we we added some tests for the ``hello`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    #...
    def hello(who="world"):
        """A "Hello world" method.
    
        :param str who: whom to say hello to
        :returns: a string
        """
        result = f"Hello {who}!"
        return result
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        assert hello() == "Hello world!
        assert hello("students") == "Hello students!

If we now execute :file:`my_first_project.py` the ``if __name__ == "__main__":``
clause evaluates to ``True`` and the two assertions are executed - successfully. 

So, adding a ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` clause at the end of a module allows it to
behave as a script. This is Python idiom comes in handy for quick testing or debugging a
module. Running the file as a script will execute the test and raise an AssertionError
if it fails. If so, we can run it in debug mode to see what goes wrong.

While this is a very productive way of testing, it is a bit on the *quick and dirty*
side. As the module code and the tests become more involved, the module file will soon
become cluttered with test code and a more scalable way to organise your tests is
needed. Micc2_ has already taken care of this.

.. _testing-your-code:

1.2.4. Testing your code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Test driven development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_ is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short
development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the
code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that
allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. The advantage of this
is clear: the shorter the cycle, the smaller the code that is to be searched for bugs.
This allows you to produce correct code faster, and in case you are a beginner, also
speeds your learning of Python. Please check Ned Batchelder's very good
introduction to
`testing with pytest <https://nedbatchelder.com/text/test3.html>`_.

When Micc2_ created project :file:`my-first-project`, it not only added a
``hello`` method to the module file, it also created a test script for it in the
:file:`tests` directory of the project directory. The testS for the
:file:`my_first_project` module is in file
:file:`tests/test_my_first_project.py`. Let's take a look at the relevant
section:

.. code-block:: python

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """Tests for my_first_project package."""
    
    import my_first_project
    
    def test_hello_noargs():
        """Test for my_first_project.hello()."""
        s = my_first_project.hello()
        assert s=="Hello world!"
    
    def test_hello_me():
        """Test for my_first_project.hello('me')."""
        s = my_first_project.hello('me')
        assert s=="Hello me!"

The :file:`tests/test_my_first_project.py` file contains two tests. One for
testing the ``hello`` method with a default argument, and one for testing it with
argument ``'me'``. Tests like this are very useful to ensure that during development
the changes to your code do not break things. There are many Python tools for unit
testing and test driven development. Here, we use Pytest_. The tests are
automatically found and executed by running ``pytest`` in the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    > pytest tests -v
    ============================= test session starts ==============================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.11.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- /Users/etijskens/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /Users/etijskens/software/dev/workspace/et-micc2-tutorials-workspace-tmp/my-first-project
    collecting ... collected 2 items
    
    tests/my_first_project/test_my_first_project.py::test_hello_noargs PASSED [ 50%]
    tests/my_first_project/test_my_first_project.py::test_hello_me PASSED    [100%]
    
    ============================== 2 passed in 0.03s ===============================
    

Specifying the :file:`tests` directory ensures that Pytest_ looks for tests only in
the :file:`tests` directory. This is usually not necessary, but it avoids that
``pytest``'s test discovery algorithm discovers test which are not meant to be. The
``-v`` flag increases ``pytest``'s verbosity. The output shows that ``pytest``
discovered the two tests put in place by Micc2_ and that they both passed.

.. note::

   Pytest_ looks for test methods in all :file:`test_*.py` or :file:`*_test.py` files
   in the current directory and accepts (1) ``test`` prefixed methods outside classes
   and (2) ``test`` prefixed methods inside ``Test`` prefixed classes as testmethods
   to be executed.

If a test would fail you get a detailed report to help you find the cause of theerror and
fix it.

.. note::

   A failing test not necessarily implies that your module is faulty. Test code is also
   code and therefore can contain errors, too.  It is not uncommon that a failing test is
   caused by a buggy test rather than a buggy method or class.

.. _debug-test-code:

1.2.4.1. Debugging test code
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When the report provided by Pytest_ does not yield an obvious clue on the cause of the
failing test, you must use debugging and execute the failing test step by step to find
out what is going wrong where. From the viewpoint of Pytest_, the files in the
:file:`tests` directory are modules. Pytest_ imports them and collects the test
methods, and executes them. Micc2_ also makes every test module executable using the
Python ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` idiom described above. At the end of every test
file you will find some extra code:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":                                   # 0
        the_test_you_want_to_debug = test_hello_noargs           # 1
                                                                 # 2
        print("__main__ running", the_test_you_want_to_debug)    # 3
        the_test_you_want_to_debug()                             # 4
        print('-*# finished #*-')                              # 5

On line ``# 1``, the name of the test method we want to debug is aliased as
``the_test_you_want_to_debug``, c.q. ``test_hello_noargs``. The variable thus becomes an alias for the test method. Line ``# 3``
prints a message with the name of the test method being debugged to assure you that you
are running the test you want. Line ``# 4`` calls the test method, and, finally, line
``# 5`` prints a message just before quitting, to assure you that the code went well
until the end.

.. code-block:: python

    (.venv-my-first-project) > python tests/test_my_first_project.py
    __main__ running <function test_hello_noargs at 0x1037337a0>     # output of line # 3
    -*# finished #*-                                                 # output of line # 5

Obviously, you can run this script in a debugger to see what goes wrong where.

.. _generate-doc:

1.2.5. Generating documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   It is not recommended to build documentation in HPC environments.

Documentation is generated almost completely automatically from the source code
using Sphinx_. It is extracted from the doc-strings in your code. Doc-strings are the
text between triple double quote pairs in the examples above, e.g. ``"""This is a
doc-string."""``. Important doc-strings are:

* *module* doc-strings: at the beginning of the module. Provides an overview of what
  the module is for.

* *class* doc-strings: right after the ``class`` statement: explains what the class
  is for. Usually, the doc-string of the __init__ method is put here as well, as *dunder*
  methods (starting and ending with a double underscore) are not automatically
  considered by Sphinx_.

* *method* doc-strings: right after a ``def`` statement, class methods should
  alsoget a doc-string.

According to `pep-0287 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/>`_ the
recommended format for Python doc-strings is `restructuredText
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_.E.g.
a typical method doc-string looks like this:

Thus, if you take good care writing doc-strings, helpful documentation follows
automatically.

Micc2_ sets up al the necessary components for documentation generation in the
:file:`docs` directory. To generate documentation in html format, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (.venv-my-first-project) > micc2 doc

This will generate documentation in html format in directory
:file:`et-dot/docs/_build/html`. The default html theme for this is
sphinx_rtd_theme_. To view the documentation open the file
:file:`et-dot/docs/_build/html/index.html` in your favorite browser . Other
formats than html are available, but your might have to install addition packages. To
list all available documentation formats run:

.. code-block:: bash

    > micc2 doc help

The boilerplate code for documentation generation is in the :file:`docs`
directory, just as if it were generated manually using the ``sphinx-quickstart``
command. Modifying those files is not recommended, and only rarely needed. Then
there are a number of :file:`.rst` files in the project directory with capitalized
names:

* :file:`README.rst` is assumed to contain an overview of the project. This file has
  some boiler plate text, but must essentially be maintained by the authors of the
  project.

* :file:`AUTHORS.rst` lists the contributors to the project.

* :file:`CHANGELOG.rst` is supposed to describe the changes that were made to the code
  from version to version. This file must entirely be maintained byby the authors of the
  project.

* :file:`API.rst` describes the classes and methods of the project in detail. This
  file is automatically updated when new components are added through
  Micc2_commands.

* :file:`APPS.rst` describes command line interfaces or apps added to your project.
  Just as :file:`API.rst` it is automatically updated when new CLIs are added through
  Micc2_ commands. For CLIs the documentation is extracted from the ``help``
  parameters of the command options with the help of Sphinx_click_.

.. note::

   The :file:`.rst` extenstion stands for reStructuredText_. It is a simple and
   concise approach to text formatting. See
   `RestructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
   for an overview.

.. _version-control:

1.2.6. Version control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version control is extremely important for any software project with a lifetime of
more a day.  Micc2_ facilitates version control by automatically creating a local
git_ repository in your project directory. If you do not want to use it, you may ignore
it or even delete it. If you have setup Micc2_ correctly, it can even create remote
Github_ repositories for your project, public as well as private.

Git_ is a version control system (VCS) that solves many practical problems related to
the process software development, independent of whether your are the only
developer, or whether there is an entire team working on it from different places in
the world. You find more information about how Micc2_ cooperates with Git_ in
:ref:`version-control-management`.

.. _miscellaneous:

1.3. Miscellaneous
------------------

.. _license:

1.3.1. License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you set up Micc2 you can select the default license for your Micc2_ projects. You
can choose between:

* MIT license

* BSD license

* ISC license

* Apache Software License 2.0

* GNU General Public License v3

* Not open source

If you’re unsure which license to choose, you can use resources such as
`GitHub’s Choose a License <https://choosealicense.com>`_. You can always
overwrite the default chosen when you create a project. The first characters suffice
to select the license:

.. code-block:: 

    micc2 --software-license=BSD create

The project directory will contain a :file:`LICENCE` file, a plain text file
describing the license applicable to your project.

.. _pyproject-toml:

1.3.2. The pyproject.toml file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Micc2_ maintains a :file:`pyproject.toml` file in the project directory. This is
the modern way to describe the build system requirements of a project (see
`PEP 518 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/>`_ ). Although this
file's content is generated automatically some understanding of it is useful
(checkout https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/pyproject/). 

In Micc2_'s predecessor, Micc_, Poetry_ was used extensively for creating virtual
environments and managing a project's dependencies. However, at the time of
writing, Poetry_ still fails to create virtual environments which honorthe
``--system-site-packages``. This causes serious problems on HPC clusters, and
consequently, we do not recommend the use of poetry_ when your projects have to run on
HPC clusters. As long as this issue remains, we recommend to add a project's
dependencies manually in the :file:`pyproject.toml` file, so that when someone
would install your project with Pip_, its dependendies are installed with it.
Poetry_ remains indeed very useful for publishing your project to PyPI_ from your
desktop or laptop. 

The :file:`pyproject.toml` file is rather human-readable. Most entries are
trivial. There is a section for dependencies ``[tool.poetry.dependencies]``,
development dependencies ``[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]``. You can maintain
these manually. There is also a section for CLIs ``[tool.poetry.scripts]`` which is
updated automatically whenever you add a CLI through Micc2_. 

.. code-block:: bash

    > cat pyproject.toml
    
    [tool.poetry]
    name = "my-first-project"
    version = "0.0.0"
    description = "My first micc2 project"
    authors = ["John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"]
    license = "MIT"
    
    readme = 'Readme.rst'
    
    repository = "https://github.com/jdoe/my-first-project"
    homepage = "https://github.com/jdoe/my-first-project"
    
    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.7"
    
    [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
    
    [tool.poetry.scripts]
    
    [build-system]
    requires = ["poetry>=0.12"]
    build-backend = "poetry.masonry.api"
